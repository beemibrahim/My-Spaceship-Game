I started working on this project a long time ago , when my dad suggested it to me , saying it would be fun. It is fun.
the hpp file has the classes I work with. And the cpp file has the member functions of those classes. And In Main, I have fundamental function like a infinite lopp.
I use threads ,(pthreads) for shooting and making stars it still in the works though. :)
